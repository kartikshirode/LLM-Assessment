Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at 
the ASE.

arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own 
devices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday 
night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the 
ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently, 
Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are 
planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.

counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Thanks,
Michael

Prudency Release,"As you may well know we are being pushed by Arthur Andersen to bring our 
prudency policy in line with that of North America.  In response to these 
pressures, we have conducted a thorough review of our prudency policy and 
have determined that all discretionary prudency and general reserves 
(including VAR based prudency) should be eliminated. Deal specific prudency 
will, however, remain. In order to avoid any arguments with AA near the

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Action from last Doorstep meeting,"Ted / Sally 

We took as an action from the last meeting the need to re-authorise all 
traders within the metals global businesses, sign this list off with the 
EnronMetals Managing Directors and accompany this list with a note 
highlighting the dangers of non authorised trading activity.

Due to the storm here yesterday we had to delay the operational control 
meeting with the MDs until today and therefore hope to have this out tomorrow 
with effect from COB 31 st.

(No Subject),"Jacques,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Re:,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet

football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to

know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee

End of Season,"Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

-Reagan

RAC risk reporting,"Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain 
non-standard reports at the request of commercial.  These reports can be 
categorized as:

""morning report"" - daily
Component V@R - daily
Adhoc V@R - as needed
Book reconciliation - as needed
Stress testing - as needed
Back testing - weekly
Correlation Matrix - bi-weekly


I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the 
upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from RAC 
to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we 
need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these 
reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk 
management groups).

In the next couple days,  I will be sending you each a listing of reports 
prepared, and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the 
best way to go forward.

EnVision - Updated,"Sally

I gave this presentation to John Sherriff, Richard Lewis and Joe Gold this 
afternoon - lots of interesting feedback !

Would love to take you through this  - I also took Joel Henenberg through an 
early draft version and suggested we should discuss it on a call with 
yourself and Mary next week.

There are some significant issues arise around Thunderball and Global Markets 
which we have started to discuss with Kevin Swenney and Cindy Horn ( I missed 
my opportunity to take Brent through all the issues this afternoon but will 
try to get to him soon ).

Hope all is well - speak to you soon

This of course being that I dont upset too many other schedules and no news occurs upon us which would preclude this.

I hate to come out sounding like a pest, but, I am eager to start.   I want to work the night shift and get back into the fasted paced environment.

Data Integrity,"Andrea,

I am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity.  
However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole 
concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our 
sessions.  It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of 
that meeting.  

I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business.  It looks like our 
action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I'll ask for an 
extension because of my travel).  In the meantime, you can meet with 
David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.

Alternatively, you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans 
without me.  (I am not sure how helpful I am in any event).  What do you 
think?

Systems,"I think we are making great progress on the systems side.  I would like to 
set a deadline of November 10th to have a plan on all North American projects 
(I'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by 
commercial, Sally's world, and Beth's world.  When I say signed off I mean 
that I want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the 
plan for each project.  If you don't agree don't sign. If certain projects 
(ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan 
will be complete.  I want much more in the way of specifics about objectives

Re: Dec99 Enron North America Wholesale Volumes,"Thanks for your help.

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is 
the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This 
was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly 
higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have 
further questions.

2001 Plan vs 2000 Forecast Explanation,"Sarah,
Below is our high level explanation of the Energy Operations (including EOL) 
increase in 2001 plan over 2000 forecast of $5.1 million.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a 
result of EOL activity, requiring additional resources to support this new 
business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the 
efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of 
supporting individual transactions has decreased significantly in the 100% to 
400%+ range.

OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.

Internet E-mail,"
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.",2011-04-12,patti.thompson@enron.com,internet e-mail,"in an effort to protect enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the global messaging team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of mailsweeper servers. what does that mean to you, the user? all inbound and outbound internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. inbound internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. if you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine. we have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. we believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.","internet e-mail in an effort to protect enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the global messaging team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of mailsweeper servers. what does that mean to you, the user? all inbound and outbound internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. inbound internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. if you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine. we have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. we believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.",2011-04

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's

football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

Kirit Purbhoo Resume,"Hi Don,

Attached please find my resume for your review.  I liked to thank you for allowing me to sit with the shift guys for the past few nights.  The exposure has been invaluable.  I worked closely with Joe Errigo, who has been extremely helpful in showing me the routine of the job.  I received some hands on training with some of the work that is expected from the shift crew.  In particular, checkouts, price discovery, identifying constraint paths, input deals into the P&L  and Enpower.  

The demanding and fast paced nature of this position is exactly what appeals to me.  My past experience with trading and scheduling should provide a good base.  I would like to sit down with you and discuss opportunities within your group.  Again, thank you for the opportunity, hope to hear from you soon.

ERMS Resources,"I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.

I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with 
our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It 
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is 
what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The 
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local 
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the 
Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to 
interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need 
to interface with the bank.

Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move

summary status of the comments,"Dear Sally,

Attached is the latest version of the summary.  It is complete, but I'm still 
waiting for Scott E to let me know if anything has been done in Panama.

You mentioned yesterday that you wanted the offices rated.  I have put a 
rating in, based on the number comments, size of the office, and severity of 
the comments, and what I understand the general attitude of the office to be, 
but you should probably take a look at it since you attended some of these

FINAL DECISION ON ACCRUAL VALUE,"Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.  
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been 
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.

MISO Approved for Start Up of Transmission Functions,"Yesterday, FERC gave approval for MISO to begin regional transmission operations on December 15, 2001.  This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and ""other regional transmission organization functions.""  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Carrie

questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a 
result of EOL activity, requiring additional resources to support this new 
business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the 
efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of

Order re. transfer of operational control to MISO,"On July 27, 2001, the Commission approved the application of Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power Company to transfer operational control of certain jurisdictional transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO when it becomes operational.  The approval was conditioned on Great River (MP's only network transmission customer) reaching agreement MP on how Great River's facilities will be operated by the ISO.  

With regard to the Midwest RTO, the Commission stated its approval of the transfer of operational control does not constitute a finding regarding the scope of an RTO for the Midwest.

So long,"Hey y'all,

as most of you would probably know by now, I have chosen to leave Enron to
pursue other opportunities.  It's been a good time (4+ years) with great
experiences both in North/South America and in Europe.

I'd like to use this e-mail to thank everybody for their good work and
friendship.  In particular (in order of appearance): Dung Tran, Jon Doyle,
Dave Ramm, Natalie Halich, Roberto Silveira and Rick Waddell have been great
sources of learning and leadership.

'Other opportunities' means exactly that - not quite sure what the next
adventure will be, but it won't be boring!  I encourage you to reply with
your personal e-mail etc., so that we can keep in touch.

All the best,
Christian

Canadian Promotions/Trip,"FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my 
promotion memo from Energy Operations.  I believe that they both work under 
Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.  I am sure that they didn't mind having 
their names included twice in promotional memos!  

Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she 
wondered if I would be coming.  I will be in South America in what should be 
summer there.  I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.  In addition to 
other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in 
Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.  I hosted a

Happy New Year - No Y2K Fear!,"We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all 
commodities front to back.  We found a few minor issues, primarily reports 
with report dates that were incorrect.  The content and underlying 
calculations in the reports were correct.  These were really just query and 
formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this 
point we feel confident about our system situation.  More will unfold with 
counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have 
we.  

Hope your new year's celebration was fun.  We saw pictures of the London 
festivies on TV as we were cooking our New Year's eve dinner last night at

Doorstep RAC Direction,"Met today w/ Causey and Sally to discuss Doorstep going forward. Following is 
my goal with this process.  Rick Carson will co-ordinate RAC's efforts in 
this area pulling in other RAC people as required.


- RAC will participate in review to determine which offices will be inspected 
and on what frequency
- RAC will help design and participate as required in inspections
- I will be able to see, through the RAC website, a list of all offices, a 
list of all offices requiring inspection, when an office was inspected, 
findings from that inspection and the follow-up from the findings.
- If follow up is not happening, a ""red flagged"" reminder notice should be 
issued via email. 

This has been a huge effort and we have to have this going forward. This is 
one ball that can not be dropped. 

Let me know your thoughts if any.

SEPA and schedules,"Hey guys,

I talked to Kayne on Monday about the various contracts we have with MDEA to ensure they continued for 2002.  KOCH, NRG, and SEPA all carry over. However, as Mike confirmed in checkouts, SEPA does NOT flow on weekends or holidays and SEPA puts out the tag without consulting us even though the schedule changes regularly.   Currently there is no SEPA schedule in OATI or the services contract book starting 01/07/2002.   Make sure when we do the next day schedules the SEPA contract matches OATI once SEPA puts out the new tags.

Last month we didn't have to place as close attention when scheduling because SEPA put out a tag for the entire month and Laura matched it in the services book for us. 

And for your reference, the January Entergy OASIS #  for WR to MDEA (30MW all day) is: 1025604 (Daily NN-6).

(No Subject),"Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?

Re:,"Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

(No Subject),"Good to finally hear from.  Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had 
some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off.
Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn 
football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we 
will be playing for the National Championship next year.  

How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?

Later-

League is Set,"It looks like we have our 12 teams.  We will probably keep the same rules 
from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are 
league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we 
draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you 
that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs 
sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.

Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, 
too early, too late.
If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.  
You all do not stand a chance!
